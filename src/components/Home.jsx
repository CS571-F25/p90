        <p>
          Clash Royale is a real-time multiplayer strategy game developed by Supercell. 
          It combines elements of collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer 
          online battle arenas. Players collect and upgrade cards featuring Clash of Clans 
          troops, spells, and defenses, then use them to knock down the enemy King and 
          Princesses from their towers to win trophies, crowns, and glory in the Arena.
